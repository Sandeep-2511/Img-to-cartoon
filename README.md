# Img-to-cartoon
You can give a cartoon effect to a photo by implementing machine learning algorithms in Python.
To create a cartoon effect, we need to pay attention to two things; edge and color palette. Those are what make the differences between a photo and a cartoon. To adjust that two main components, there are four main steps that we will go through:
1.Load image
2.Create edge mask
3.Reduce the color palette
4.Combine edge mask with the colored image.
